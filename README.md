# Note-Taker

## Overview
The Note Taker application is a simple web-based tool built using Express.js for the backend. It allows users to write, save, and delete notes, which are stored persistently in a JSON file (db.json). The front end is served statically with HTML and interacts with the backend through AJAX requests using Fetch API.

## Features
- Create and Save Notes: Users can enter a new note title and note text, then save it using the "Save Note" button.
- View and Delete Notes: Existing notes are listed on the left-hand side. Clicking on a note displays it on the right-hand side, and clicking the trash icon deletes it.
- Responsive Design: The application is responsive and works well on desktop and mobile browsers.
- Data Persistence: Notes are stored and retrieved from a JSON file (db.json) on the server.

## Technologies Used
- Express.js: Backend framework for handling routes, requests, and responses.
